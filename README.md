A TicTacToe project that allows a player to play a computer opponent.

The computer opponent works by recursively finding all possible move sequences, noting whether they end in a win, loss, or tie and then hash mapping the results to find the best move. 

This project is not perfect in terms of efficiency however it is fully functional.
